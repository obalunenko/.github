# .github
Default files for repositories.

GitHub will use and display default files for any public repository that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- the root of the repository
- the .github folder
- the docs folder

For example, anyone who creates an issue or pull request in a public repository that does not have its own CONTRIBUTING file will see a link to the default CONTRIBUTING file.

The files are not included in clones, packages, or downloads of individual repositories because they are stored only in the .github repository.

Supported file types
The default file types supported by GitHub are as follows:

- CODE_OF_CONDUCT: A CODE_OF_CONDUCT file defines standards for how to engage in a community.
- CONTRIBUTING: A CONTRIBUTING file communicates how people should contribute to your project.
- FUNDING: A FUNDING file displays a sponsor button in your repository to increase the visibility of funding options for your open source project.
- Issue and pull request templates: Issue and pull request templates customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository.
- SECURITY: A SECURITY file gives instructions for how to responsibly report a security vulnerability in your project.
- SUPPORT: A SUPPORT file lets people know about ways to get help with your project.

Note: License files must be added to individual repositories so the file will be included when a project is cloned, packaged, or downloaded.
